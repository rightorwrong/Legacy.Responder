Evolve CMS Legacy Template
================

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/EvolveCMS-Project/Legacy.Responder.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/EvolveCMS-Project/Legacy.Responder)

Refactor WordPress to remove all views from container files, functions and classes and place them here. This does not replace the template functionality for user themes. It simply removes the WordPress application HTML code from files that should not contain them to help clean the code.
